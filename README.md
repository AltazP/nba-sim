This project takes 2 teams of any 5 current nba players. Based off their effeciency and defensive rating, we calculate the scores of both teams and the winner.
All player stats are scraped off https://basketball.realgm.com/ using Beautiful Soup.
The game will ask you to enter player names, going back and forth between each team. 
If a players name is entered incorrectly, you will be told to enter their name again.
Once all 10 players have been chosen you will be asked to continue, then displayed the final score, along with the winnner.
